In summary, there are only a few data in the li- terature related
to the claustrum of the human brain.
Additionally, computer-aided 3D reconstructions of the claustra and measurements 
regarding the di- mensions of these structures have not been report- ed previously.
In this study, a feasible, reliable, and valid method for 3D reconstruction from any serial sections or images was presented using a real hu- man cadaver. This technique gives significant unre- ported information about the dimensions and 3D relationship of the claustrum and surrounding struc- tures.
Therefore, this study will be a very useful an- atomical guide for neuroscientists and neurosur- geons interested in the claustrum.
