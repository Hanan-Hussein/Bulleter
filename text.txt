it has been suggested that the function of the claustrum (CL) may be to orchestrate and integrate
the activity of the different cortical areas that are involved in a particular function by boosting
the synchronized oscillations that occur between these areas. We propose here a model of how this
may be done, thanks to the unique synaptic morphology of the CL and its excitatory and inhibitory
connections with most cortical areas. Using serial visual search as an example, we describe how
the functional anatomy of the claustral connections can potentially execute the sequential activation
of the representations of objects that are being processed serially. We also propose that 
cross-frequencycoupling (CFC) between low frequency signals from CL and higher frequency oscillations in
the cortical areas will be an efficient means of CL modulating neural activity across multiple brain regions in synchrony.
this model is applicable to the wide range of functions one performs, from simple object recognition to reading and writing,
listening to or performing music, etc.
