* In summary, there are only a few data in the li- terature related
 
* To the claustrum of the human brain.
 
* Additionally, computer-aided 3d reconstructions of the claustra and measurements 
 
* Regarding the di- mensions of these structures have not been report- ed previously.
 
* In this study, a feasible, reliable, and valid method for 3d reconstruction from any serial sections or images was presented using a real hu- man cadaver. this technique gives significant unre- ported information about the dimensions and 3d relationship of the claustrum and surrounding struc- tures.
 
* Therefore, this study will be a very useful an- atomical guide for neuroscientists and neurosur- geons interested in the claustrum.
